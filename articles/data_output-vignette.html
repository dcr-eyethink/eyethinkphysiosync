<p>Here’s an explanation of each of the data files produced by the
eyethinkphysiosync. The key thing is to think about what is on each row
of the data set, which is stated in the titles below</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="pd-csv---participants">pd.csv - participants<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#pd-csv---participants"></a>
</h2>
<p>This has all we know about individual participants (demographics,
debriefing notes, manipulation checks) and their experimental session
(date, time, experiment version, conditions). If they carried out some
sort of rating or performance task at the end of the main experiment,
that data will be here in summary form. There is also data about the
mean EDA (media) and range which is used to exclude anomalous EDA data,
eg if the sensor wasn’t working well. The key column is pid =
participant ID, which ties all this data together.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="ed-csv---physiological-sample">ed.csv - physiological sample<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#ed-csv---physiological-sample"></a>
</h2>
<p>These files have one row per person, per physiological sample, per
measurement during the experiment. Since we have, eg, 15 samples per
second for EDA measurements, these can be very large files. The time
codes are given in column t as universal time codes (utc) which you can
convert in R or using an online converter. More useful is tt, which is
the time in seconds from the onset of the experimental trial. The
different physiological signals are identified by the dv column (note
EDA is referred to as EA here), and the data is given both in raw form,
and in the norm which has been normalised/z-scored for that individual
participant. There are also columns to help identify the trials
(typically, category, condition, stim, item). By filtering this data set
can be used to plot the time course of physiological signals over the
course of individual stimuli.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="td-csv---trials">td.csv - trials<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#td-csv---trials"></a>
</h2>
<p>This data set is probably most useful for analysis and inferential
statistics, as it contains one row per participant, per trial or
stimulus presented. As well as information identifying the trial
(category, condition, stim, item) there will be behavioural data
captured by gorilla post presentation, such as their ratings of the
stimuli. If there was a behavioural test at the end of the experiment
about this particular item (eg a memory test), then that data will be
summarised and reported here. There is summary physiological data
derived from ed.csv, such as the mean and range of heart rate (eg
raw_mean_HR), in raw and norm format. And finally, there are summary
statistics from cross recurrence analysis that are calculated by
averaging over rows of r.csv. Typically in our analyses, we look at
DET_EA, which is the determinism in the EDA signal, and is the signal pf
physiological synchrony that we find has the strongest link to
engagement. Note that you may see NAs in these columns for some people -
these wil be cases where the sensor failed or got a bad signal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="sd-csv---stimuli">sd.csv - stimuli<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sd-csv---stimuli"></a>
</h2>
<p>This file is derived from all the others above, and summarises all
the data we have to produce means for individual items or stimuli that
can be compared to other external data. For example, you could rank
movie trailers from most to least engaging, and then try and correlate
that with their global box office takings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="r-csv---dyads-of-trials">r.csv - dyads of trials<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-csv---dyads-of-trials"></a>
</h2>
<p>This is the output from our cross recurrence quantification analysis
(CRQA). The analysis works by calculating the recurrence between pairs
of time series, that we call dyads. For us, these times series are of
the physiological signals from two people looking at the same stimulus.
So for every trial, we have one row for every dyad of participants who
saw it, for each of the physiological measures (given in dv column).
There is the standard information to identify the trial, as well as the
to identify the two participants (pinfo1 and pinfo2). Usually, we look
at the recurrence between everyone who saw the same stimulus in the same
condition, but sometimes we might be interested in contrasting sub
groups based upon who those people are in the dyads (for example, men vs
women). If so then sgroup will tell you if the two people in the dyad
are from the same ingroup (eg it will say in if they are both women or
both men) or out groups (eg out for one man one woman), and pgroup will
tell you, for the in-groups, which groups the two people are a member
of. To get the cross recurrence values that are in a particular row of
td.csv (say participant Joe looking at stimulus A) all we do is average
across every row in which participant Joe is one of the two people in
dyad, and they are both looking at A. Again, we are most interested in
the DET measure here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="rw-csv---recurrence-of-dyads-per-second">rw.csv - recurrence of dyads per second<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#rw-csv---recurrence-of-dyads-per-second"></a>
</h2>
<p>This is the same as r.csv above, only the trial is split into chunks
of time (typically 1 second), so that we can look at the time course of
recurrence values.</p>
